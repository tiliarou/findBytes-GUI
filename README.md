# findBytes GUI
**Port your patches, update your offsets - Nintendo Switch**

---

**findBytes** is a tool originally developed by **Dualie**, which helps find offsets in different versions of Nintendo Switch games. **AmazingChz**, then decided to make a nice UI out of it, because who doesn't like UIs?

## HOW TO RUN SOURCE CODE:

  - Download [Python 3.6.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/) (make sure to check "**Add Python to PATH**" in the installer. Otherwise, "**pip3**" won't work!)

  - Install PyQt5 (run "**pip3 install PyQt5**" in *CMD*, after downloading [Python 3.6.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/))
  
  - Download [findBytes.py](https://gist.github.com/3096/ffd6d257f148aab0b74bfc50dfe43e80)
  
  - Put [findBytes.py](https://gist.github.com/3096/ffd6d257f148aab0b74bfc50dfe43e80) into `.\resources\tools\findBytes\`
  
  - Run "**main.py**", and follow its instructions
